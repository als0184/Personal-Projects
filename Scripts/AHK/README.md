# Hotkey Scripts using AutoHotKey
Welcome to my collection of hotkey scripts! Intended for convenience, these tools help to streamline my daily tasks, and act as a fun side project.

# Overview:
- **Window Manager HotKey**: Easily reposition your active window using these hotkeys.
  - **Ctrl+Alt+C**: Center the window without resizing.
  - **Ctrl+Alt+Left**: Move to the left half of the screen.
  - **Ctrl+Alt+Right**: Move to the right half.
  - **Ctrl+Alt+Up**: Move to the top half.
  - **Ctrl+Alt+Down**: Move to the bottom half.
  
- **Date HotKey**: Enter 'dat' and the date will auto-fill in **'MMMM d, yyyy'** format.
- **Name HotKey**: Enter 'als' to auto-complete your name. Adjust the initials in the script and the name to match yours for personal use.
- **Email HotKey**: Enter 'eml' to auto-fill your email. Adjust the email included in the script to match yours for personal use.
- **Clipboard History HotKey**: Reiterate through the three most previous clipboard copies.
  - Cycle through your last three clipboard items with Ctrl+Shift+V.
  - The script maintains a history of the three most recent clipboard copies.
  - When you use the hotkey, it pastes the previous item from your clipboard history.
  - Each subsequent use of the hotkey cycles back one more item, allowing you to access up to the last three copied items.
 
By the way, these scripts run using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). If you would like to use any of the scripts described above, install AutoHotKey and add the script to a new HotKey file!
