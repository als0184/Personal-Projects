# Natalee Savage Personal Website - Beta Version

Welcome to the repository of the beta version of Natalee Savage's personal website. This project marked both my journey into the realm of web development and the creation of a comprehensive website for Natalee.

## Overview

This project started with the intent to design and implement a personal website, using core web technologies, and to provide me with a hands-on learning experience as I delved into web development. 

### Key Responsibilities

- **Full-Cycle Development**: Managed and led the complete development process, from conceptualization to final implementation.
- **Front-end & Back-end Development**: Ensured the integration of both front-end visual elements and back-end functionalities.
- **Web Technologies**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft a user-centric experience. 

## Current Status - Beta Version ðŸš§

It's essential to note that the files included in this repository represent only the **Beta Version** of the website. While the primary design and functionality have been tackled, it still awaits:

- Comprehensive testing.
- Feature updates and refinements.
- Full-scale responsive design implementation.

This beta version sets the foundation for the upcoming development milestones. There is still a significant amount of work to be done, and your feedback and suggestions will be invaluable in enhancing the final product.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project!
